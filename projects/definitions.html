    <h2>Internet</h2>
        <p>The internet is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other
        on a global network. </p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
        <p>The web is a bunch of web pages connected together </p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and the Web different?</h2>
        <p>The internet is computers communicating with each other and the web is
            pages connected together.</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
        <p>ASCII is something everyone uses to encode characters on computers and 
            other machines that use ASCII. It uses a 7 bit binary language which 
            means any combination of zeros and ones in 7 character spots code for 
            127 different letters, numbers or commands. Unicode is similar but it 
            uses 16 bit binary and includes characters from outside the English language.</p>
    <h2>UTF-8</h2>
        <p>UTF-8 is like ASCII but uses 8 bit binary. It is the most commonly used coding 
            standard on the web.</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
        <p>URL is short for Uniform Resource Locator. It's basically the address of a webpage.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
        <p>A domain name is what the internet user types in to get to a website i.e. typing in 
            facebook.com to get to facebook.</p>
    <h2>HTTP and HTTPS</h2>
        <p>HTTP is short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's used
          transfer data between the server and browser. HTTPS 
         uses encryption and is just safer than HTTP</p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
        <p>An IP address is an address made up of numbers and periods used to 
            identify the network a computer is using. It's good to track the location 
            of where someone is using a computer</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>DNS is short for Domain Name System. It changes a domain name into an IP address 
            so other computers can interact with it</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) are basically the government of the internet.
            They come up with rules and standards to help the internet run smoothly around the 
            world. They recommend using certain things to make websites so the internet itself
            is more uniform and effiecient</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
        <p>XML is short  for Extensible Markup Language. It makes rules for things such as documents
            to be readable by both human and machine when they're encoded. 
            XHTML is short for Extensible  Hypertext Markup Language. It just makes HTML into XML format.
        HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard for making websites. 
        HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It has a bunch of new features like videos and canvas.</p>
