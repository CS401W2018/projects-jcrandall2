            <h3>Nikola Jokić</h3>
                <p>Nikola Jokić is the greatest player in the national basketball
                association and has been for the last 5 years. He is a force of nature who can pass, shoot,
                rebound, and defend. Averaging a triple double every night he plays is alien level. The only
                player who can compare to his triple double prowess is Russell Westbrook.
                </p>
            <h3>Russell Westbrook</h3>
                <p>Russell Westbrook is NOT washed. He is a veteran hooper who still has a ton to offer to a team
                such as the Denver Nuggets. He is a great passer can still get to the rim at will. He is a freak athlete
                and has had a triple double some of the same nights as Jokic getting one as well.
                </p>
            <h3>Jamal Murray</h3>
                <p>Jamal Murray aka Blue Arrow is the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers
                Every time the Lakers play Denver Jamal Murray cannot miss. I also really like playing in his signature
                shoe, the New Balance 2WXY V4.
