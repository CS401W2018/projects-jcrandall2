    <p>Aloha class pehea oe? O Jonah ko'u inoa.
         That's Hawaiian for my name is Jonah. 
         I love to learn languages. 
         I speak French, Spanish, Haitian Creole, 
         Lingala, learning Hawaiian, and English. 
         I'm also passionate about immersing myself 
         in the culture of the place I'm in. When I 
         was in Congo, I wore panne (A cool african fabric),
          ate fufu, and learned Lingala to better communicate 
          with the native people. Here in Hawaii, I've made Hawaiian 
          studies one of my minors. I've learned some of the language,
        a lot about canoe and land care, and how to "live Aloha."  </p>
        <p>I'm also passionate about fitness! I love self improvement, 
            whether it be about lifting more, running faster or longer,
            being more flexible, jumping higher, or just being more healthy.
            I don't like being out of shape, and I don't like being weak. 
            If I'm not consistenlty training I'm ancy and uncomfortable.
            It's gotten to the point where my mental health is reliant on 
            the endorphins I get from working out. You be the judge of whether
            my view of the gym is <mark>healthy</mark> or not lol.

    &quot It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too <b>strong</b>, but too <b>weak.</b>
     We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition
      when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on 
      making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer
       of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.&quot
