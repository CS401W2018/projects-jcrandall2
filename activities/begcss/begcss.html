        CSS uses the "style" attribute to change the appearance of HTML elements.
        People don't usually use it in large projects because it is hard to maintain.
        </p>"
        <p>Embedded CSS is when you use the "style" attribute in the header of the html file. 
            It makes it apply to the whole page.
        </p>   
        <p>
            External CSS is when you use a separate file to style the page. It's best for large projects, you can 
            use it in each page of the folder. <bold>ONLY</bold> use this one for the class to avoid confusion and keep
            all your projects uniform.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selectors are used to select which elements to style.
