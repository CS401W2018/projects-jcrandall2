    <h2>Physical Progress</h2>
    <h3>Luke 2:52 - "And Jesus increased in... Stature."</h3>
    <h2>Post-Mission-Me</h2>

    <p>I got home from my mission August 15th, 2021. I had skinny legs and arms, a 
        tummy and was whiter than a ghost. Weighing in at 175 pounds and determined to 
        transform my body, I started running and lifting weights. My roommates in Hale 3 
        room 122 helped me learn form and technique, and I ran the bike path almost every day. 
        The weight I was lifting began to go up and I was able to run faster and farther.
        I also got a job at Seasider Sports, where I could play sports clocked in. It was great!
    </p>

    <h2>I Need a Challenge</h2>

    <p>Running and lifting is great but I really needed to prove to myself that I can do hard things
        even after my two year mission. So, I signed up for the Honolulu Marathon. Training my first
        26.2 was intense, and my gameplan was very rudimentary. I just ran, no diet, no recovery techniques,
        no running buddy. My goal was to complete the marathon in sub 4 hours, but I missed it by 36 minutes.
        Now I had an excuse to run it again the next year. I had a better training plan, running buddies and 
        did better with fueling and gear. Yet again I missed my mark, this time only by 11 minutes.
        So I ran it again the next year, this time with some lifelong friends who had never ran one before.
        We ended up running it in 5 hours but it was my most enjoyable marathon yet. It was also amazing to 
        cross the finish line with my buddy. My running journey is far from over. I'm still chasing that sub 4.
    </p>

    <h2>Weight a Minute!</h2>
    <p>I also like having big muscles, but it gets difficult to be in marathon shape and also lift a lot of weight
        and look good too. So when I wasn't training for a marathon, I was lifting weights. So far in my lifting journey,
        I've been able to get to the 2,3,4 mark. That means I can bench press 225 pounds, squat 315 pounds and deadlift 405 pounds.
        The next goal is to reach the 1,000 pound club, where my total squat bench and deadlift max lifts reach 1000 pounds total.
        Lastly, after this last marathon I've gotten a little fat, so I'm attempting to cut 20 pounds and get back down to a healthy 200.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I stay motivated?</h2>
    <p>I don't know how healthy it is to be dependent on exercise for mental health, but I 100% am.
        Endorphins from running and lifting make me feel like a million bucks. I run and lift with friends who
        don't know much about fitness, and I love to watch them make progress. Looking good with your shirt off is 
        a must if you attend BYU Hawaii, that by itself is motivation enough to keep myself in shape.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I'm proud of myself! I'm excited to see what personal records I smash in my future, with running and lifting.</p>
