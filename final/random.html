<h1>Random Progress</h1>
<p>
    I've picked up quite a few hobbies while here in Hawaii that will bless me
    for the rest of my life. Here are a few of them:
</p>

<h2>Choir!</h2>
<p>
    I did choir for the majority of my time at BYU Hawaii. I was in the
    Chamber Choir, which is the top choir on campus. I was able to perform at 
    events in Honolulu and hold concerts on campus. Learning many songs in 
    different languages was a great experience, and helped me connect with my 
    filipino, japanese, and polynesian peers on campus.

<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>
    I've perfected the art of playing Ness in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I'm quite
    literally unstoppable with him. My children will be humbled and will know who's boss
    when I play with them
</p>

<h2>Fixing Cars and Mopeds</h2>

<p>
    If you're a broke college student like me, you'll learn how to fix your own
    car and moped. Learning these skills helped me to save money on repairs and help
    my friends with their cars and mopeds which have had their fair share of problems.
    My wife and kids will never have to go to a mechanic because I can fix anything!
