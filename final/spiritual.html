        <h2>Luke 2:52 - "And Jesus increased in... Favor with God."</h2>
        <p>Keeping the gift of the Holy Ghost with me at all times is something I needed to make a bigger priority in my life.</p>

        <h2>Things I've Done to Increase My Spirituality</h2>
        <h3>Religion Classes</h3>  
        <p>I've taken a lot of religion classes here at BYU Hawaii that have deepened my understanding of Greek and Hebrew in scriptures. I've also learned a lot about the history of the church and current events that are happening in the church. I love learning about the gospel and how it applies to my life.</p>
        
        <h3>Institute</h3>
        <p>Institute with Brother Meyers has been one of my favorite weekly occurrences. He's a great teacher and always has something to say that touches my heart. I always leave with the spirit, and it's a great midweek spiritual boost. It has helped me stay consistent post-mission.</p>
        
        <h3>Callings</h3>
        <p>I've tried to hold a calling in each of the wards I've been in while I've studied here. I've been first counselor in the elders quorum presidency, Sunday school president, and most recently I've been the Family Home Evening coordinator for the Hale La'a Ward for the last year and a half. Serving others has deepened my conversion and has helped me fill my time with good things.</p>
        
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtLqOENHHgk">The Power of Spiritual Momentum</a>
        <p>It's harder to stop something already in motion, so building up your spiritual momentum by going to the temple, reading your scriptures and attending church helps to 
            keep your covenants and stay close to the spirit.
