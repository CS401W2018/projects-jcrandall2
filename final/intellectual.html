        <h3>College</h3>
        <p>I love college at BYUH! I've learned so much coding and about Hawaii for my
            minors, and so much about the natural sciences such as biology and chemistry. 
            Something I've come to accept is that learning is and always will be a part of my
            life. I'm never done learning things and I love it! I'm set to graduate in
            the spring, and I have some great future plans to further my academic career.
        </p>
        <h3>Dental School</h3>
        <p>I'm planning on applying to dental school in the fall of 2024. I have to retake Organic Chemistry II and 
            Physics lab I, but I'm excited to get started on this journey of application and acceptance. I
            want to go to UNLV dental school because it's close to home and has a great
            program. I also want to be able to work with my dad and help him with his
            practice. Teeth and smiles are my future and I can't wait to become an expert in these fields of study and 
            work.
        </p>
        <h3>More!</h3>
        <p>I want to learn how to sail as well so I can join my Dad on his sailing trips. So classes
            and certifications for sailing are on my list of things to do. I also want to learn
            how to scuba dive and get my certification. I want to be able to go on trips with
            my family and friends and explore the ocean.
